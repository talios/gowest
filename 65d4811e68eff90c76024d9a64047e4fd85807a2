      "message": "Good point - currently not. I was thinking about this earlier and not sure how I\u0027d decide WHEN to remove it.\n\nOne \"workaround\" I was thinking of was storing the channel per project rather than change, since we\u0027re only only pushing Event\u0027s down it, and the check for cancelling a build matches on the ChangeId.\n\nThis would mean we\u0027d only ever have as many channels as there are projects.\n\nThoughts?",
